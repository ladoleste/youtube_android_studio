# The YouTube sample App ported to Android Studio
The YouTube Android API seems to have stopped in Time. [The most recent documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/setup) still refers to Eclipe and makes you import a jar to get it working.

There's an [enhancement issue](https://code.google.com/p/gdata-issues/issues/detail?id=7048) open but there's no sign that Google cares about it.

This project just get it working on Android Studio 2.2 so you can play with it right away.

**Important**: Do not forget to register for an API and set it in the DeveloperKey class.
